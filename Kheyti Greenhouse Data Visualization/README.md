## About Organization
Kheyti is an organization enabling climate-resilient livelihoods for smallholder farmers through its Greenhouse-in-a-Box model.
This model has revolutionized farming for 7,000+ smallholders in India, slashing water use by 98% and doubling farmer incomes. As they look toward their goal of reaching one million farmers by 2033, we are stepping in to help them visualize that impact.
