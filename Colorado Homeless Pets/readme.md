## About Organization
No Kill Colorado is a nonprofit animal welfare advocacy organization dedicated to creating a compassionate future for all pets in the state. Unlike a shelter or rescue, the organization focuses on systemic change through advocacy, education, and data-driven reform. Its mission is to promote the No Kill Equation, a proven framework of humane, lifesaving strategies, and to advocate for solutions that ensure every healthy and treatable homeless pet in Colorado has the opportunity to live.

No Kill Colorado actively collaborates with local and state public officials to improve the performance and accountability of Colorado’s animal shelter system. This system, which licenses over 300 shelters and rescues across the state, generates a substantial volume of data each year. No Kill Colorado analyzes this data to identify trends, spotlight areas for improvement, and drive policy and community-level change in support of animal welfare.

## Project Objectives
This project, "Data for Paws," aims to transform raw animal shelter and rescue data from Colorado (2016-2024) into actionable insights to improve animal welfare.

## Approaches
### Data Wrangling
•  Cleaned and transformed multi-year Colorado shelter data, analyze trend on intake, outcomes, and community impact to support the programs and services that will help every healthy and treatable pet find a safe outcome.
•  Used Python (Pandas) to reshape datasets (melt), split/merge fields, and standardize formats for reporting.
•  Enriched records with geographic insights by mapping ZIP codes via Google Maps API
• Collaborated with global volunteers across US and EU time zones to deliver the analysis.
